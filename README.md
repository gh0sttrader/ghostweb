# Ghost Trading

This is a Next.js starter for Ghost Trading, created in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the `.env.workspace` file to a new file named `.env.local` and fill in the required values.
    ```bash
    cp .env.workspace .env.local
    ```
    You will need to create a Firebase project and get a Google AI API key.

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`.
